                    <h5>IMPORTANT: ADHERE TO STATE GUIDELINES</h5>
                    <p>Most states have released their own guidelines for inbound and outbound travellers regarding
                        passes, permits, quarantine rules, and other requirements. Please go through the guidelines of
                        your source and destination state carefully before planning your travel for a hassle-free
                        experience.</p>
                    <h5>ROLE OF MADDOX </h5>
                    <p>
                        Maddox only provides a technology platform that connects intending travellers with bus operators
                        using the services of a service provider. It doesn’t operate any buses or offer transportation
                        services to users. Maddox also doesn’t act as an agent of any bus operator in providing the
                        above-mentioned technology platform services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bus ticket booking voucher issued by the Maddox platform to a user is solely based on the
                        information provided or updated by the bus operator or service provider regarding seat
                        availability.

                        details pertaining to the bus service are provided by the respective bus operator. Maddox has no
                        control over such information provided by the bus operator.
